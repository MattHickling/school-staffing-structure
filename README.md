# school-staffing-structure

Overview
The staffing and absence planning web application is designed to assist schools in organizing their staffing structure and managing employee absences. The application will allow users to create and edit schedules for teachers and other staff members, track absences, and make adjustments as needed to ensure adequate coverage.

Technologies
The application will be developed using Python for the backend logic, HTML for the frontend user interface, and SQL for the database management.

Features
The staffing and absence planning application will include the following features:

User Authentication and Permissions
The application will require users to authenticate themselves to access the system. Users will be assigned permissions based on their role in the school, such as teacher, administrator, or staff member. Different roles will have different levels of access to the system's functionality.

Staffing Structure Management
The application will allow users to create and manage staffing structures for the academic year, including teacher and staff schedules. Users will be able to assign staff members to classes, sections, or other roles.

Absence Tracking
The application will allow users to log employee absences, including the reason for the absence and the expected duration. Users will also be able to view current and upcoming absences for each staff member, as well as any substitutes who have been assigned to cover the absence.

Substitute Management
The application will allow users to assign substitutes to cover absences, and will provide a list of available substitutes based on their qualifications and availability. Users will be able to specify which staff members are eligible for substitute assignments, and set rules for how substitutes are selected and notified.

Reporting and Analytics
The application will provide reports and analytics on staffing structure and absence trends, including the number of absences per staff member, the reasons for absences, and the effectiveness of substitute assignments. Reports will be exportable to common formats such as PDF or CSV.

Conclusion
This specification outlines the basic features and functionality of a staffing and absence planning web application for schools. The application will be developed using Python, HTML, and SQL, and will include user authentication and permissions, staffing structure management, absence tracking, substitute management, and reporting and analytics.
